			Here at Operation Opportunity, we have noticed a real need from the
			students today for guidance when it comes to furthering their education.
			It's important to be ready and confident for these big steps in life.
			Taking good prep classes in high school, learning crucial study and note
			taking skills, and not being afraid of the application and admittance
			processes reduce stress and make students more successful All students
			deserve a fair opportunity to higher education. That's what we are
			committed to!
